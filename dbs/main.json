Our initial research noted potential frameworks for constructing the application, such as Serious Games, Loco-Narrative Harmony and the DÃ©rive, as well as potential stories to tell within the local indigenous Eora and Dharug nations. In future research, we will continue making and iterating our application to examine these methods for their usefulness in storytelling.",

            "description": "Abstract: The construct of the non-player character (or NPC), mechanically, is seen in most modern video games and is an important point of interaction for players. In this paper we take a look at an affective-based approach to examining NPCs based on both their capacity for companionship with the player ascribed through affect theory, as well as their existence as a self-impelled entity through post-human performativity theory. With this approach in mind, we have synthesised a gameplay experience with the companionship of the NPC as a driving force to examine how such a relationship can be defined. In this gameplay, the player is bound to a character that they become emotionally attached to throughout the narrative. We identify a temporal approach to NPC relationships that may enhance interactions with characters by making them non-repeatable through narrative intervention.",
